# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical inconsistencies between the GLSP frontend (TypeScript/Web) and backend (Rust/MCP Server) that are causing communication failures, data format mismatches, and integration issues. The system currently has misaligned interfaces, inconsistent data structures, and incompatible protocol implementations that prevent proper operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Protocol Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend and backend to use consistent MCP protocol implementations, so that communication between client and server works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends MCP tool calls THEN the server SHALL respond with the exact format expected by the client
2. WHEN the server returns tool results THEN the response format SHALL match the TypeScript interfaces defined in McpService
3. WHEN resource requests are made THEN both wrapped and direct response formats SHALL be handled consistently
4. IF the server uses PulseEngine MCP framework THEN the client SHALL be compatible with its response format
5. WHEN error responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 error format consistently

### Requirement 2: Data Structure Alignment

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want consistent data structures between frontend and backend, so that diagram models and WASM component data are properly synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagram models are serialized THEN they SHALL use consistent field naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
2. WHEN WASM component data is transmitted THEN interface structures SHALL match between Rust and TypeScript definitions
3. WHEN position data is sent THEN coordinate systems SHALL be consistent between client and server
4. IF diagram types are specified THEN they SHALL use the same enumeration values on both sides
5. WHEN element properties are updated THEN the property schema SHALL be identical in both implementations

### Requirement 3: Tool Interface Standardization

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want standardized tool interfaces, so that all MCP tools work consistently across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are called THEN parameter names SHALL match exactly between client expectations and server implementations
2. WHEN tool responses are returned THEN the content structure SHALL be consistent with TypeScript interface definitions
3. WHEN WASM component tools are invoked THEN they SHALL return data in the format expected by WasmRuntimeManager
4. IF optional parameters are used THEN they SHALL be handled consistently on both client and server
5. WHEN error conditions occur THEN tool error responses SHALL follow the standardized format

### Requirement 4: Resource URI Consistency

**User Story:** As a client application, I want consistent resource URI handling, so that diagram and component resources can be accessed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource URIs are constructed THEN they SHALL follow the same pattern on client and server
2. WHEN diagram resources are requested THEN the URI format SHALL match server expectations
3. WHEN WASM component resources are accessed THEN the path resolution SHALL be consistent
4. IF resource content is returned THEN it SHALL match the expected MIME types and formats
5. WHEN resource lists are requested THEN the response format SHALL be compatible with client parsing

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Environment Alignment

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want aligned configuration between frontend and backend, so that the system can be deployed and configured consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server transport is configured THEN the client SHALL connect using compatible settings
2. WHEN WASM paths are specified THEN both client and server SHALL use the same path resolution
3. WHEN port configurations are set THEN they SHALL be consistent across all components
4. IF authentication is enabled THEN both client and server SHALL use compatible auth mechanisms
5. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be recognized by both frontend and backend

### Requirement 6: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling, so that error messages are clear and actionable across the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be formatted consistently between client and server
2. WHEN connection failures happen THEN error messages SHALL provide actionable information
3. WHEN tool execution fails THEN error details SHALL be properly propagated to the frontend
4. IF validation errors occur THEN they SHALL include specific field information
5. WHEN timeout errors happen THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully on both sides

### Requirement 7: Type Safety and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe interfaces, so that data integrity is maintained throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be validated against consistent schemas
2. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL match Rust struct definitions
3. WHEN optional fields are used THEN they SHALL be handled consistently in serialization
4. IF enum values are used THEN they SHALL be identical between frontend and backend
5. WHEN nested objects are transmitted THEN their structure SHALL be preserved accurately
